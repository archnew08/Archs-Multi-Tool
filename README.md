# Arch's Multi Tool
## Discord Multi Tool

Arch's Multi Tool (AMT) can perform many different tasks to assist you with any Discord-related tasks you may require.
Currently, there are only three (3) command options but many more should be expected soon.
**Current options:**

- Nuke server (bot token needed)
- Webhook message sender

Note that with the Discord C# package AMT uses, pinging `@everyone`, `@here`, and individually pinging people is possible.
Also note that this is an **early development version** and bugs should be expected.
